TorchExpo Governance
====================

Governance Philosophy
---------------------

TorchExpo is currently in the process of adoptiong a governance philosophy similar to PyTorch. It is carved keeping the initial authors' design ideas and decisions. Currently we are looking for core developers who will challenge as well as improve our design. 

Apart from the authors of the project and core developers, the community is encouraged to contribute, file issues, make proposals, review pull requests and be present in the community. We are not providing ownership to anyone as of now. 

Key people and their functions

Project maintainers provide leadership and direction for the TorchExpo. Specifics include:

- Articulate a cohesive long-term vision for the project
- Possess a deep understanding of the PyTorch Ecosystem and TorchExpo codebase

Core Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TorchExpo will be developed by a team of core developers, who'll sketch the roadmap for design, releases and also other necessary things for improvements.

While membership is determined by presence in the "TorchExpo" organization on GitHub, contribution takes many forms:

- Committing changes to the repository
- Reviewing pull requests by others
